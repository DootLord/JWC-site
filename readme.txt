Set up is 

index.html -> login.html -> betting.html

index will just be a login page for admin/guest. this will connect to SQL database.
Admin will have it's own page, used to controle the video, thinking of using this to start the stream.
Guest will just go to betting.html

betting.html will have the stream in a box center, bellow is a text box to enter bet, followed by ramaining points avalible to bet.
bellow is a radio of hourses with a countdown before bet's are locked in.

PHP
connect to database when needed.
Dynamicly show who is voting for what hourse when the raido is selected.
Do some otherstuff like time maybe, just have fun with it I guess.

Socket.io / ajax
Video Stream

Anything else that could be good.
